## Repository for code of the paper:

Using text feature to improve valence prediction 
in dimensional speech emotion recognition

accepted in oCOCOSDA 2020

Experiments:
- text only
- acoustic only
- acoustic+text

Database:  
- IEMOCAP

Results (table/chart) for each database
1. Result of single-dimension valence prediction
2. Result multi-dimension speech emotion recognition --> chart:  
V, A, D, Mean from   
Acoustic  
Text  
Acoustic+Text  

3. Impact of using different pre-trained word vector (bert also?) --> Low.

# We already observerd w2v and fasttext, 
# but GloVe obtain better
